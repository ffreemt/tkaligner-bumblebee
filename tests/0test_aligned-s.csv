,昨天下午又冷又有雾。,
,我想就在书房炉边消磨一下午，不想踩着杂草污泥到呼啸山庄了。,
Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold.,,
"I had half a mind to spend it by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering Heights.",,
"On coming up from dinner, however (N.B. I dine between twelve and one o'clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that I might be served at five), on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders.",但是，吃过午饭（注意――我在十二点与一点钟之间吃午饭，而可以当作这所房子的附属物的管家婆，一位慈祥的太太却不能，或者并不愿理解我请求在五点钟开饭的用意），在我怀着这个懒惰的想法上了楼，迈进屋子的时候，看见一个女仆跪在地上，身边是扫帚和煤斗。,0.91
,她正在用一堆堆煤渣封火，搞起一片弥漫的灰尘。,
,这景象立刻把我赶回头了。,
"This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles' walk, arrived at Heathcliff's garden gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower.",我拿了帽子，走了四里路，到达了希刺克厉夫的花园口口，刚好躲过了一场今年初降的鹅毛大雪。,0.81
"On that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air made me shiver through every limb.",在那荒凉的山顶上，土地由于结了一层黑冰而冻得坚硬，冷空气使我四肢发抖。,0.85
"Being unable to remove the chain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.",我弄不开门链，就跳进去，顺着两边种着蔓延的醋栗树丛的石路跑去。,0.76
,我白白地敲了半天门，一直敲到我的手指骨都痛了，狗也狂吠起来。,
`Wretched inmates!',“倒霉的人家！”,0.71
"I ejaculated mentally, `you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality.",我心里直叫，“只为你这样无礼待客，就该一辈子跟人群隔离。,0.73
"At least, I would not keep my doors barred in the day time.",我至少还不会在白天把门闩住。,0.83
I don't care--I will get in!',我才不管呢――我要进去！”,0.79
,如此决定了。,
"So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.",我就抓住门闩，使劲摇它。,0.69
